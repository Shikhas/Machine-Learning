# Machine-Learning

The topics Covered are:

-----------------------------------------------Unsupervised Learning--------------------------------------------------
1. Non-Parametric Methods - Density estimation, outlier detection and nearest-neighbor algorithm.

2. Bayesian Desicion - Used to find association rules in Market Basket Analysis - Bread -> Butter and Beyond - Data mining in Supermarkets

3. K-Means Clustering - Compact data(Also includes Elbow and Silhouette method to find optimal number of clusters)

4. Spectral Clustering - Connectivity based data clustering 

-----------------------------------------------Supervised Learning-----------------------------------------------------
5. Decision Tress - finding the contents of each node and calculating split entropy of each split in decision tree to analyse the optimal split.
 
6. Multinomial Logistic Regression - performing multinomial logistic regression and also calculating the odd ratios.
