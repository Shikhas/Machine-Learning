# Machine-Learning

The topics covered in this repo are:

-----------------------------------------------Unsupervised Learning--------------------------------------------------
1. Non-Parametric Methods - Density estimation, outlier detection and nearest-neighbor algorithm.

2. Bayesian Desicion - Used to find association rules in Market Basket Analysis - Bread -> Butter and Beyond - Data mining in Supermarkets

3. K-Means Clustering - Compact data(Also includes Elbow and Silhouette method to find optimal number of clusters)

4. Spectral Clustering - Connectivity based data clustering 

-----------------------------------------------Supervised Learning-----------------------------------------------------

 5. Decision Tress - finding the contents of each node and calculating split entropy of each split in decision tree to    analyse the optimal split.
 
 6. Multinomial Logistic Regression - performing multinomial logistic regression and also calculating the odd ratios.
 
 7. Identifying and Profiling the Clusters in Chicago Pothole data ->Performed clustering of 18K observations using K-Means     Clustering and determined number of clusters using Silhouette and Elbow charts. Profiled the clusters using Classification     tree and criteria of Giniâ€™s value.
 
 8. Comparing Logistic Regression model and Classification tree model to predict how likely a policy-holder will file a claim     using RASE, AUC metrics and ROC curve.
